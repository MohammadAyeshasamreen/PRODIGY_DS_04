## Welcome to my submission for *Task 4* of the *Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech*.

In this task, I performed *Sentiment Analysis* on textual data to determine the polarity (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of user opinions expressed in tweets or reviews.  

The goal of this project is to apply *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* and *Machine Learning* techniques to extract insights from text data and classify the overall sentiment accurately.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this task contains text samples (tweets, reviews, or posts) along with their sentiment labels.

You can use:
- *Twitter Sentiment Dataset* (publicly available), or  
- *Sample Dataset from Prodigy InfoTech*

Each record typically includes:
- *Tweet / Text*
- *User / ID*
- *Timestamp*
- *Sentiment Label (Positive / Negative / Neutral)*

## üß∞ Tools and Libraries Used

- *Python*
- *Jupyter Notebook*
- *Pandas* ‚Äì Data manipulation and analysis  
- *NumPy* ‚Äì Numerical computations  
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* ‚Äì Data visualization  
- *NLTK / TextBlob* ‚Äì Natural Language Processing  
- *Scikit-learn* ‚Äì Machine Learning model building and evaluation  

## üß† Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Displayed sample records and data statistics.
- Checked sentiment distribution and data balance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Preprocessing
- Removed special characters, punctuation, links, and mentions.
- Converted text to lowercase.
- Tokenized text and removed stopwords.
- Applied *Lemmatization* for text normalization.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction
- Converted textual data into numerical vectors using:
  - *TF-IDF Vectorizer* or
  - *Count Vectorizer (Bag of Words model)*

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Split dataset into *Training (80%)* and *Testing (20%)* sets.
- Built and trained classification models such as:
  - *Logistic Regression*
  - *Naive Bayes*
  - *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*
- Predicted sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - *Accuracy Score*
  - *Confusion Matrix*
  - *Classification Report*
  - *Precision, Recall, F1-Score*
- Compared results to find the best-performing algorithm.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
- Created *word clouds* for positive and negative sentiments.
- Used *heatmaps* and *bar plots* to visualize class distribution and feature importance.

## üìà Key Insights

- *Positive* sentiments were the most common across the dataset.  
- Words such as ‚Äúgood,‚Äù ‚Äúexcellent,‚Äù ‚Äúhappy‚Äù strongly correlated with positive sentiments.  
- *Text preprocessing and lemmatization* improved classification accuracy significantly.  
- The *Logistic Regression* and *Naive Bayes* models performed well with high precision and recall.  

## üßæ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* and *Machine Learning* for sentiment classification.  
By analyzing textual data, businesses can understand public opinion, track brand reputation, and improve customer satisfaction.

Through this task, I gained valuable experience in:
- Text preprocessing and cleaning  
- NLP-based feature extraction  
- Sentiment classification using ML models  
- Visualizing and interpreting model results
